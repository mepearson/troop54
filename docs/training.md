# Adult Training

Interested adults can go to the BSA's [my.Scouting](https://my.scouting.org/) website, create an account, and take any or all of the online courses for adults at any time.  Your BSA ID number can be supplied at any time - before OR after the online training is completed (see note below).  However, for your training records to be linked to T-54, your BSA ID number must be entered.  If you do not have your BSA ID number at the time that you take a course, you will need to later log into your account at the my.Scouting website and update your profile by adding your ID number.

BSA's Youth Protection Training requirements:

    * Youth Protection Training (YPT) is required for all BSA registered volunteers, regardless of their position.  This includes, and is not limited to, merit badge counselors.
    * Youth Protection Training must be taken every two years.  If a volunteer's YPT record is not current at the time of recharter, the volunteer's registration will not be renewed.
    * New leaders are required to take YPT before submitting an application for registration.  The certificate of completion for this training must be submitted at the time the application is made and before volunteer service with youth begins.

The YPT guidelines must be followed by all adults participating in Scouting activities regardless of whether the adult is a registered leader or not.

For more information about the YPT guidelines, please check these BSA websites:
      [BSA's Youth Protection Policy](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth-protection/)
      [Youth Protection and Adult Leadership](https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/gss01/)

After taking YPT, please do the following:

    1. Print and retain your certificate, and
    2. Send a message to the troop's [Registrar](mailto:registrar@troop54houston.org) that you have completed YPT, and attach a copy of your certificate if possible.

To view your training:
You can view all of your on-line training completions via your my.Scouting account.  Once your adult application is processed by BSA and connected to T-54's database, you will also be able to see your training via your ScoutBook account.
