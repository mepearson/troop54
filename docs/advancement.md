# Advancement

Troop 54 utilizes the "Scoutbook" software system for tracking advancement, addresses, camping nights and scout's other information.  Each scout and her parents should have received instructions on how to access the Scoutbook system and view advancement reports.  To get further guidance on accessing the Scoutbook system or to have a copy of a scout's advancement report emailed to you, please contact our Troop 54 Advancement Chair at advancement@troop54houston.org.

## BOR Scheduling
With over 30 registered Scouts, Troop 54 has the following process to organize / schedule Boards of Review (BoR's) for rank advancement.  That process is as follows:

BoR's held on Mondays will take place between 6:30 - 7:00 pm only (latest start time will be at 6:50), in order not to interfere with the weekly Troop meeting that should start promptly at 7:00.
BoR's will be by appointment only (no walk ins).  To make an appointment the Scout needs to send an e-mail to the Advancement Chair at advancement@troop54houston.org.  BoR's must be requested at least one full day advance (by the end of Sunday if you plan to have a BoR on Monday), and week in advance is preferred.
Each Scout who scheduled a BoR needs to bring with her a parent who can volunteer to do a BoR for another scout that same evening.  This does not apply for BoRs during camping trips.
A Scout needs to arrive in Full Class A Uniform and upon arrival, should sign-up with the Advancement Chair to hold a slot and to and obtain a BoR form.
In order not to delay the start time of BoRs it is important to know that Scoutmaster Conferences should not be planned on the same day of the BoR.
It is preferred to have a Scoutmaster Conference 1 or 2 weeks before, ideally during camping trips.  It is also preferred that all requirements be completed prior to a Scoutmaster Conference, but not required.
Troop 54 understands that special circumstances may arise and an exception needs to process above needs to be considered.  In which case, please feel free to discuss further with the Scoutmaster or the Advancement Chair.

## Policy on Active Participation
 
One of the BSA requirements for rank advancement is to participate actively in the activities of the troop and patrol.  Troop 54's definition of "active participation" for rank advancement is explained in the Troop's Handbook (link).

The Scoutmaster along with other adult volunteers monitor participation by individual scouts.  Camping nights and attendance at troop meetings are recorded.  However, with large and growing troop, it is always a challenge to track all arrivals and departures.  Each scout is encouraged to keep a record of her participation either in her Scout Handbook or some notebook.  As an aid, this worksheet can be helpful.  When a scout requests a Scoutmaster Conference for rank advancement, any records maintained by that scout can be used to supplement the troop's participation records.

## Religious Awards
From the BSA national website:
"To encourage members to grow stronger in their faith, religious groups have developed the religious emblem programs.  Scouts BSA has approved of these programs and allows the emblems to be worn on the official uniform.  The various religious groups administer the programs."

Troop 54 has girls that belong to various Christian denominations as well as many other faiths.   Most major religious groups sponsor religious awards, and Troop 54 encourages each family to participate in the program of that family's religious faith.

For an index of the various religious award programs, click here.

The God & Country religious program is supported by most Protestant dominations, including the Episcopal Church.  There are minor variations, and some requirements need to be completed with a clergy member from the Scout's specific domination.

The God & Country program has the following four components:
 
            God & Me
            Grades 1 - 3
 
            God & Family
            Grades 4 - 5
 
            God & Church
            Grades 6 - 8 (see note below)
 
            God & Life
            Grades 9 - 12

The course to earn the God & Church award is offered most years for those Scouts who belong to St. John the Divine Episcopal Church and Scouts from any other Protestant domination who wish to participate in St. John's program.  This course will be conducted in a series of meetings in November, December and January of each year.  This course is designed for Scouts who are taking confirmation classes (usually during 7th grade), but the award can be earned by Scouts who are younger or older.  For Scouts who are Catholic, Jewish or of other faiths, Troop 54 can assist with arrangements for Scouts to earn the religious awards offered by organizations of those faiths.  For the Scouts who complete this program, the religious award is presented on Scout Sunday in February.

An adult coordinator is needed for this program.  To volunteer or for more information, please contact the Troop Committee Chair or the Troop's Chartered Organization Rep.
