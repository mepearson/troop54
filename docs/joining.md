## ADULT
For an ADULT to become a registered leader at Troop 54, he/she needs to do the following:

1.  Register online with Boy Scouts of America at this LINK.   (BSA's My.Scouting website).  Your submitted application will be sent to the Troop’s Registrar, who will do a reference check by contacting your three references.  Make sure your references will be available to talk with our Registrar.  Any questions can be sent to our Registrar at registrar@troop54houston.org.

2.  Youth Protections Training
Adult leaders are required to complete YPT prior to becoming a registered leader, and must renew this training every second year.  This online training takes approximately 1 hour.

NOTE:  To complete the YPT training and register online, you will need to have a BSA account in your own name with a BSA ID number.  To create a BSA account and get a BSA ID number, start at https://my.scouting.org/ – see the “Create Account” button.  If you think you have ever registered yourself (including in Cub Scouts), check the forgot username first so you don’t create a second account.

3.  Medical Forms
Download the appropriate medical form from the links above, complete and print.  Deliver the completed form along with copy of insurance card and immunization record to our medical records coordinator.  To arrange delivery, contact that person at medical@troop54houston.org or by checking the Contact Us page on the T-54 homepage.

Additional Training
In addition to the required YPT course, all adult leaders at T-54 are required to complete the specific training for the position in which they wish to serve (Asst Scoutmaster, Committee Member, etc). First do the online portion at my.scouting.org, then register for the in-person components, if needed.
