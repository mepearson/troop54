# Annual Plan of Activities

Troop 54 has regular Troop Meetings or Courts of Honor on each Monday evening during the school year.  Meetings are usually omitted during school holidays.

The troop plans to have four to six weekend campouts each year.  The locations are usually BSA camps, state parks or private ranches.  Some of the campouts are near Houston and some are further away, such at the Texas Hill Country.  Group transportation is arranged for some of the campouts, especially when further from Houston.

The troop sponsors two or three week-long trips each summer.  This will usually be to a BSA camp where merit badges and other advancement activities are held.  Some of these summer camps may offer "high adventure" activities such as backpacking treks.  Due to the summer heat in Texas, at least one summer camp will be to an areas of the country that has pleasant camping weather.

An important component of the Scouting program is youth leadership development.  For this reason, the girls in Troop 54 do much of the planning, organizing and leading for these activities.  Parents need to understand that Troop 54 is a youth-led organization, and the girls who are running the troop need to understand that they have responsibilities beyond what is normal in many other clubs or activities.
