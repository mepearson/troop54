# Youth Leadership

Youth leadership development is one of the primary goals of the Scouting program.  Troop 54 and the local BSA council offer various leadership training classes.  To advance to the ranks of Star, Life or Eagle, each girl is required to activity demonstrate leadership by holding one of the sixteen formal leadership roles for a specified number of months.

At Troop 54, all scouts above the rank of First Class who seek leadership credit for Star, Life or Eagle must sign a Leadership Agreement with the description of her Position of Responsibility ("POR") attached, and present these documents to the Scoutmaster for approval.  A listing of all approved positions is provided below.

The [Leadership Agreement form](https://www.troop54houston.org/downloads/POR_Leadership_Agreement.pdf) is required of all scouts seeking leadership credit to advance in rank.  To receive leadership credit, the scout must obtain support from the adult leader overseeing her position, and approval from the Scoutmaster.  Credit for "Leadership Months" starts only after the Leadership Agreement is signed and these approvals have been obtained.  Leadership Credit is not automatically given, and the scout must actively manage the process.  This support and approval must be obtained before seeking a Scoutmaster Conference for rank advancement, and must be documented in the ScoutBook records.

Upon completion of each rank, the scout must complete a new [Leadership Agreement form](https://www.troop54houston.org/downloads/POR_Leadership_Agreement.pdf) before earning credit for the next rank.  Scouts holding the position of SPL, ASPL or PL must complete a new [Leadership Agreement form](https://www.troop54houston.org/downloads/POR_Leadership_Agreement.pdf) following the change of SPL, i.e., at the end of the spring semester and at the end of the calendar year.

To receive leadership credit, Ms. Burke must sign-off on the Den Chief Log Sheet at the start as well as at the end of time in the role.  The Den Leader must also confirm participation for each activity, and also sign-off at completion of time in the role.  All approvals can be tracked on the Log Sheet.

Some activities done by Den Chiefs involve more leadership or time than other activities.  A point system has been developed for weighting the various activities.  In addition to the required months in that role, a scout needs to earn a minimum of 25 activity points for Star and 40 points for Life.  That point system and a Log Sheet for tracking activities are available at the following:
