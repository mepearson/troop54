# About Troop 54

Troop 54 is open to all girls aged 11 to 17 of any faith and background who will commit to live by the Scout oath and law to participate in program focused on youth leadership development, outdoor activities, advancement opportunities and service to others.  We meet at St. John the Divine Episcopal Church where there is a long and rich history of scouting.

## Troop 54 Focus Areas
### 1.  Youth leadership development
This is a girl-led troop!  We emphasize the patrol method.  We expect that a large portion of our scouts will regularly serve in roles where they can develop their leadership skills.  We encourage 8th-grade girls to attend National Youth Leadership Training.  After completing the NYLT course, our scouts will be invited to attend the advanced leadership training camp at Philmont in the summer.
### 2.  Outdoors program
We go camping on a regular basis.  Our weekend campouts have a variety of activities including backpacking, shooting sports, canoeing & kayaking, and climbing.  We sponsor a wide range of summer camping experiences including backpacking throughout North America.
### 3.  Advancement program
Our First Class Trail program runs continuously and is designed for girls to join the troop at any point in the year.  We typically offer 20-30 merit badge classes each year, plus district merit badge fairs and badges at summer camps.  We provide support and encouragement for of our scouts to earn the rank of Eagle.

### 4.  Service to others
We believe that young people develop a "spirit of service" through being regularly involved in helping others.  Whether it's helping with an Eagle project, participating in T-54 sponsored community service projects, or just assisting each other in outdoor activities, our scouts are developing life-long habits of service to others.
