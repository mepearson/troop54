We place great emphasis on having a \"Scout\u2010led\" Troop.</p> <p>Troop 54 serves girls aged 11 to 17. As with most average size scout troops, we expect to have between 30 to 60 registered Scouts organized into small patrols. Our Scouts are expected to attend many different public and private schools and come from a variety of faiths.</p> <p>Whom to contact</p> <p>A Scout's first point of contact with questions, concerns, etc., should always be her Patrol Leader, or failing that, her Patrol Assistant Scoutmaster (\"PASM\"). A parent's first point of contact should be his or her daughter's PASM or, if a problem persists, the Scoutmaster. (The Scoutmaster is usually very busy on Troop meeting nights, so if possible, please pick another time to speak to him about your daughter's advancement, etc.) For all summer camps, the single designated Scout Master / Trek Leader / Campmaster for that camp from Troop 54 is a parent's first point contact for issues related to that trip. If you need further help, contact the Troop Committee Chair.</p> <p>Use of email</p> <p>Troop 54 makes heavy use of email; addresses and other contact information is taken from ScoutBook and also made available on the Troop 54 website. Therefore, it is important to keep contact information of all registered participants up-to-date in ScoutBook.</p> <p>Uniforms</p> <p>See the Uniforms section in this Troop Handbook. Uniform items and other Scouting items can be purchased at the Scout Shop, on the southeast corner of the North Loop (inside the loop) and East T.C. Jester, 2225 N Loop W. For placement of patches, see the BSA's official Insignia Guide on the Web.</p> <p>Troop meetings</p> <p>The Troop's weekly meetings are on most Monday nights during the school year, at 7:00 pm in the Scout Room at The Church of St. John the Divine (Episcopal), our chartered organization at 2450 River Oaks Blvd. Scouts are NOT required to attend every weekly Troop meeting, but more is better. Our meetings are run by the Scouts themselves, with discreet coaching by adult leaders only when needed; that means meetings may seem chaotic.</p> <p>Campouts</p> <p>The Troop plans to go on at least three weekend campouts each semester during the school year, as part of an annual program that is planned and executed by the Scouts themselves. The equipment list in the online Troop Handbook will give you an idea what you will need to buy for your Scout.</p> <p>Summer camp</p> <p>We also plan to go to summer camp at some awesome places, from merit\u2010badge camps for all Scouts and to high adventure camps for the more\u2010experienced ones. See the online Troop Handbook for examples. Summer camp is not mandatory, but it is highly encouraged -- Scouts have a ton of fun, earn advancement and merit badges, and literally grow up at summer camp. With Scoutmaster approval, we welcome adults who are willing to go to summer camp as Assistant Scoutmasters; they must take the required training. \ufffc</p> <p>Advancement; merit badges</p> <p>Scouts advance in rank at their own pace by completing the requirements for each applicable rank (see the Scout Handbook for details). The Troop plans to do a lot of organized advancement activities; see generally the Advancement and Merit Badge sections of the online Troop Handbook for more information.</p> <p>Registering with Troop 54</p> <p>Girls between the ages of 11 and 17 (inclusive) may join Troop 54. Cub Scouts girls who have completed the Arrow of Light (or completed the 5^th^ grade) may join the Troop at age 10. See the Troop Website for a list of forms that you and your Scout will need to complete (http://troop54houston.org/registration.html).</p> <p>What Troop 54 provides</p> <p>The Troop provides each new Scout who has paid her dues with an embroidered Troop 54 neckerchief and slide, a Scout Handbook, handbook cover, unit number, and personalized name tag. All other personal gear is the responsibility of the Scout and her parents. The Troop furnishes each patrol with a stove, propane, cooking gear, a dining fly, and a lantern owned by St. John the Divine (SJD). SJD also owns a fleet of canoes, a troop trailer as well as other scout gear, that Troop 54 shares with Troop 55.</p> <p>Dues and expenses</p> <p>Dues are $196 per year per Scout. This covers the annual BSA registration fee ($80, and the premium for BSA provided insurance ($6), both paid directly to BSA and billed by BSA on an annual basis. This also includes the Troop operating fee ($110) paid every calendar year to the Troop on the online store ([[https://shop.troop54houston.org/](https://shop.troop54houston.org/)](https://shop.troop54houston.org/)). New scouts pay an additional $65 to the Troop to cover a T-54 neckerchief, handbook, and other items upon joining. New scouts also pay an additional $25 joining fee to BSA when initially joining. Registered adult leaders are required to pay the BSA annual fees for registered adult leaders of $66. In addition to dues, each Scout should expect to pay approximately the following: Uniform: $80. Campouts: $20 per campout for food, plus $10 to $15 per campout for travel meals, spending money, and sometimes $20\u201065 for bus transportation (special activities such as canoeing, boating, shooting, etc., will have additional costs). Summer camp: Typically, $400 to $700 for a week of merit\u2010badge summer camp (excluding transportation). High\u2010adventure camps for older Scouts normally will cost more.\u00a0</p> <p>Financial assistance</p> <p>Scouts have opportunities to earn some or all their dues and expenses by participating in Troop fundraising activities; in addition, scholarships may also be available (see the Scholarship section of this handbook for more details).</p> <p>Special needs Scouts</p> <p>Make the Scoutmaster and your Scout's PASM aware of your daughter's special needs.</p> <p>Troop Committee</p> <p>The Troop 54 Committee meets the second Thursday of each month (except June &amp; July) at 6:00 pm virtually (using Zoom or similar tools), subject to change. All parents of scouts and Adult leaders are encouraged to attend.</p> <p>Adult involvement</p> <p>We need YOU! As with any troop, the \"official\" adult leaders can't possibly do it all. We have both \"outdoor\" and \"indoor\" adult jobs. We're friendly and supportive, we'll train you, and we absolutely, positively guarantee you'll have a great time. Experience shows that, the more involved a Scout's parent is in the Troop's adult leadership, the more likely the Scout is to remain in Scouting and someday earn the rank of Eagle Scout.</p>"},{"location":"Troop54-handbook/#active-participation","title":"Active Participation","text":"<p>The advancement requirements for each of the Scout ranks (as set forth in the Scout Handbook) includes some requirement that the Scout be active in her troop and patrol.

For campouts that are one to two hours away we will usually take school buses or vans. For longer trips, such as Enchanted Rock, we often charter a coach bus. The cost for transportation is included in the campout signup. Adult drivers are strongly encouraged to take as many Scouts with them as possible (always observing the two\u2010deep rule for youth protection). Per the Guide to Safe Scouting, we do not travel in convoys. The Troop trailers are pulled by an adult driver.</p> <p>Campout food (\"grub\")</p> <p>Both Scouts and adults (the \"Goat Patrol\") cook by patrols. Each patrol's designated grubmaster for the campout is responsible for planning the weekend menu, buying food, and supervising the cooking. Goats should plan to model good camping practices by cooking foods that Scouts could cook with their standard patrol gear. If a Scout or adult signs up for a campout and food is purchased, the Scout or adult is responsible for the grub fee even if he or she ends up not attending the campout. TIP: Before your new Scout's first campout, have her do some cooking and clean\u2010up at home (ideally, together with her patrol); that will make it easier for her (or them) to cook and clean up at their first campout.</p> <p>Campout jobs</p> <p>Everyone works at a campout, Scouts and adults alike. Each Patrol Leader designates individual Scouts to be in charge of planning patrol menus, collecting money, arranging transportation, preparing equipment, buying food (\"grubmaster\"), cooking and clean up. Every patrol, including the Goats, should have a duty roster covering the entire campout weekend.</p> <p>Campout schedule</p> <p>The typical schedule for campouts is approximately as follows:</p> <p>\u2022 Friday night: Arrive at the campsite, set up camp, have a snack (\"cracker barrel\").</p> <p>\u2022 Saturday: Breakfast. Morning activities. Lunch. Afternoon activities. Free time / advancement work. Dinner. Campfire.</p> <p>\u2022 Sunday: Breakfast. Scout's Own chapel service. Break camp: clean up patrol equipment; inspection and stowage of patrol equipment. Clean sweep of the campsite. Depart for home.</p> <p>Camping equipment</p> <p>Each Scout is responsible for her personal gear; see the list of recommended personal gear. Troop 54 provides shared patrol gear, including lanterns, stoves and cooking equipment, for each patrol. A Patrol Quartermaster (Patrol QM) (who is a Scout) is responsible for her patrol's cooking gear (action packer) on each campout. Generally, that Scout will bring home this gear from the Troop meeting the Monday before the campout. The Patrol QM should check for missing items, and clean the gear if needed. The Patrol QM will also return home with this gear after the campout. She should clean it thoroughly and restock the action packer before returning it to the Scout closet at the following</p> <p>meeting. (Patrol members should help clean up patrol gear before leaving the campout.) No food should be left in the patrol equipment box between campouts.</p> <p>Campout rules</p> <p>The following rules apply to all Scouts and adults. The Scout Oath and Scout Law govern everyone in camp, including both Scouts and adults, at all times.</p> <p>Sign\u2010ups: Everyone, Scouts and Adults, must be signed up in advance to attend any campout. (How to sign up will be announced at Troop meetings or by Troop newsletter or e\u2010mail.) Just showing up at camp or at the departure point is not acceptable.</p> <p>Uniform requirements: Scout and adult leaders are to wear their Field (Class A) uniform to and from the campout and to flags. Scouts should wear the Activity (Class B) uniform for the remaining time, except for sleeping or activities that require different attire. See the Uniform section on this Handbook for more details</p> <p>Camping is by patrols: At campouts, patrol members camp together in the location designated for their patrol. Sharing of tents by Scouts within a patrol is encouraged. Adults do not share tents with Scouts, including their own daughters, and generally avoid the area of their own daughter's patrol. Adults (the \"Goat Patrol\") ordinarily will camp in their own designated campsite. On some occasions, two to three adults (PASMs) will be assigned to camp with each Scout patrol, but not with the patrols of their own daughters.</p> <p>Stay out of other patrols' areas: Scouts should request permission before entering another patrol's campsite. Adults should request permission before entering any Scout patrol site (except that patrol's PASMs, who camp with the patrol). Adults should discourage Scouts from being in the Goat area unless they have a specific need to be there.</p> <p>Hands off: Don't touch someone else's equipment, tent, or belongings, unless you have the owner's prior permission.</p> <p>Everyone works: All Scouts and adults are expected to do their share of patrol duties in accordance with the duty roster.</p> <p>Keep the campsite squared away: All campers are to continually keep shipshape their tents, personal gear, and patrol\u2010 and troop gear. The entire Troop assembles for a \"clean sweep\" of the camping area at the end of each campout.</p> <p>Fire safety: Scouts may build and light ground fires (cooking and campfires) only when and where authorized by the Scoutmaster, Patrol Assistant Scoutmaster, or the Campmaster. No unauthorized fires are permitted. Fire safety rules will be strictly enforced. A fire must never be left unattended.</p> <p>No electronic equipment, liquid fuels or other prohibited items. The use of liquid fuels by Scouts or Goats for starting any type of fire is prohibited. EXCEPTION: If the Scoutmaster has previously authorized the use of backpacking stoves at a campout, liquid fuel will be dispensed and re\u2010collected by the quartermaster or his/her designee at the campout. No Scout or Goat except the quartermaster or his designee shall travel to or from a campout with liquid fuel in a backpacking stove tank. (See also the list of prohibited items and Mobile Communication Device Policy)</p> <p>No flames in or near tents. No fires or open flames (including stoves, lanterns or propane bottles) are allowed in or near tents.</p> <p>Buddy system. The buddy system is simple: Never leave your buddy nor let her leave you.</p> <p>Vehicle rules. Keep vehicles out of the campsite at all times, including when loading and unloading Scouts, adults and their personal gear, except as specifically authorized by the Campmaster. Leave cars in the designated parking areas.</p> <p>Water\u2010safety rules. Scouts and Goats are to follow Safety Afloat and Safe Swim Defense procedures and policies at all times for all water activities. All Scouts and adults must take the standard BSA swim test to determine how they can participate in aquatic activities.</p> <p>Hazardous Weather: during a campout a unit may experience hazardous weather situations including thunderstorms, flash floods, excessive heat, ice, and/or snowstorms. To mitigate the risk of such situations, the Scoutmaster and/or Campmaster will adjust plans and activities as necessary and as prescribed by BSA's Hazardous Weather training (which is required for all Assistant Scoutmasters and Scoutmasters).</p> <p>Lights Out: All Scouts are to be inside their tents at 10 pm (or otherwise at the Scoutmaster's or Campmaster's discretion). Lights will be out and talking will stop by 10:30 pm. No Scout should leave her tent (except for brief trips to the latrine or to report illness or other emergency) until reveille the next morning.</p> <p>No fighting, hazing, harassment, or excessive roughhousing: There will be no hazing or harassing (physical or verbal) of any kind. Fighting, hitting, wrestling, or rough horseplay are not permitted. A Scout will not put herself or another Scout in physical danger.</p> <p>No early departures unless excused: Scouts are strongly encouraged to attend the entire campout. Scouts may not leave the immediate camp area without the express permission of the Scoutmaster or Campmaster, and must check out with the Campmaster just before departure. Unless a Scout has an urgent need to leave early, and has been excused by the Senior Patrol Leader (SPL) and Scoutmaster, all Scouts are to remain in camp until dismissed by their Patrol Leader after the Troop's \"clean sweep\" of the campsite.</p> <p>No alcoholic beverages (it's BSA policy) or illegal drugs (it's the law). Tobacco use by adults is strongly discouraged (it's BSA policy), and by Scouts is prohibited (it's the law).</p> <p>No non\u2010Troop 54 siblings / youth: Non\u2010Scout siblings are not welcome on campouts. Their presence tends to detract from the program focus and undermine enforcement of campout rules.</p> <p>Consequences of failing to abide by the camp and Troop rules may include time\u2010outs, extra work detail, calls home, being sent home, or in severe cases being suspended or even expelled from the Troop. Parents may be required to travel to camp at their expense and take a Scout home who fails to abide by the Troop and camp rules. A warning system will be in effect for minor inappropriate behavior problems. Consequences will be assigned as warranted.

In all cases, the two guides are the final authority if they address a specific issue.</p> <p>[See also the Merit Badge Counseling and Scout Responsibilities for Advancement sections of this Handbook.]</p> <p>Basic information</p> <p>Scouts wishing to advance in rank above First Class must earn a specified minimum number of merit badges for each rank. Merit badges work differently than Cub Scout activity badges and pins. Instead of passing requirements with parents or den or pack leaders, Scouts pass merit badge requirements with adult leaders registered as merit badge counselors. Counselors might or might not be adult leaders in Troop 54.</p> <p>There are more than 135 merit badges covering a range of outdoor skills, life skills, hobbies, and careers. Some are designed to be of interest to younger Scouts and others to older Scouts. The rank of Eagle requires 21 merit badges, with 14 of them prescribed.</p> <p>The difficulty of a merit badge depends on the badge and on the age and experience of the Scout. For instance, Backpacking and Environmental Science are quite challenging, while Fingerprinting and some craft badges are very easy. There are four basic categories of merit badges:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Life skills -- e.g., Personal Management, Citizenship in the     Community</p> </li> <li> <p>Scout skills -- e.g., Camping, First Aid, Pioneering, Orienteering</p> </li> <li> <p>Careers -- e.g., Engineering, Law, Health Care Professions, American     Business</p> </li> <li> <p>Hobbies -- e.g., Stamp Collecting, Collections, Pets, Rifle     Shooting, Canoeing</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note that the merit badges required for the rank of Eagle come from the first two categories.</p> <p>Youth Protection principles must be followed during all merit badge activities. As a registered Scouter, the merit badge counselor must be current in her or his Youth Protection Training and adhere to all policies of Scouts BSA.</p> <p>Scouts BSA policy requires that the Scout must hold a discussion with the Scoutmaster to identify an approved counselor for the merit badge work. That discussion is documented through adult leader approval in Scoutbook or signature on the Application for Merit Badge blue card. Because of the size of Troop 54, the Scoutmaster has delegated authority to approve all merit badges to the Scout's PASM when the counselor or merit badge class is approved by the Sam Houston Area Council. All other counselors and offerings must be approved by the Scoutmaster.</p> <p>Current requirements for each merit badge are available online at Scouting.org and can be readily found using a search engine. Scouts are encouraged to obtain and read the current pamphlet published by BSA (available at the Scout Shop or Amazon.com) for the merit badge but doing so is not a requirement. Troop 54 maintains a library of some merit badge pamphlets available for use. Contact the Troop Librarian for access to the pamphlets.</p> <p>Merit badge requirements do change over time. Some troops maintain libraries on the Internet of older versions of merit badge pamphlets, available for free download. While the content of these older pamphlets can be useful, Scouts must ensure they are working with the latest set of requirements and not an older set. Merit badge counselors will only accept work for the latest set of requirements.</p> <p>Many merit badge counselors work with groups of Scouts by holding merit badge classes on an occasional basis during the year. Announcements and signups for merit badge activities are made generally by email, in the troop newsletter, or by announcements at Troop meetings. Many merit badges can be earned in a group setting at summer camp or in district or council merit badge fairs.</p> <p>Due to the nature of some merit badges, a Scout attending a merit badge class at a summer camp, merit badge fair, or museum might complete only a portion of the requirements for a merit badge. Under these circumstances, the Scout should also identify the counselor she plans to use to complete the requirements.</p> <p>When the counselor is satisfied that the Scout has met each requirement, the Scout should be sure to remind the counselor to approve all requirements in Scoutbook or sign the blue card. In the case of a blue card, the Scout is then accountable to turn in the Application for Merit Badge portion of the blue card to the Troop Advancement Chair. The Scout should notify her PASM or the Scoutmaster when the merit badge is complete so that the requirements can be evaluated for completeness. At the next Court of Honor, the Scout will receive the merit badge and an achievement card.</p> <p>Troop 54 strongly recommends that a Scout should not:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Earn more than three Eagle\u2010required merit badges with the same     counselor</p> </li> <li> <p>Earn more than five total merit badges with the same counselor</p> </li> <li> <p>Earn any merit badge with the Scout's parent as counselor unless the     Scout is part of a merit badge class of five or more Scouts</p> </li> </ul> <p>Meeting Merit Badge Requirements</p> <p>A Scout cannot earn a merit badge merely by simply sitting through a class. Each Scout must individually demonstrate to the counselor that she has met each requirement for the badge. This can often be difficult to do in a class\u2010type setting.</p> <p>Each Scout is expected to follow the requirements exactly as stated in the merit badge pamphlet---no more and no less. If the requirement says show or demonstrate, then just talking about the requirement or watching it demonstrated is not enough. The same is true for words or phrases such as make, list, in the field, collect, identify, and label.</p> <p>Worksheets for most merit badges are available through various online resources. Merit badge counselors may ask you to use these worksheets, and many do, but simply filling out these worksheets is not evidence that the actual requirements were passed. The worksheets exist simply as a tool to aid communication between the Scout and the counselor.</p> <p>Neither a counselor nor the Troop may modify, add, or delete requirements for a merit badge. Nevertheless, a Scout on his or her own initiative may exceed the requirements.</p> <p>There is no time limit for completion of merit badge requirements, as long as the requirements are completed before the Scout's 18th birthday. A Scout may work with more than one counselor on completing requirements. For instance, a Scout might not complete all requirements at a summer camp. Subsequent counselors may not, however, retest the Scout on completed and documented requirements. To prevent confusion when such situations arise, the Scout should keep all records associated with the completed requirements to the extent possible and any issued blue cards until the merit badge is approved as completed by the PASM or Scoutmaster.</p> <p>For practical advice about earning a merit badge, the following web sites might be useful:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Boy Scouts of America     ([https://www.scouting.org/programs/scouts-bsa/advancement-and-awards/merit-badges/]{.underline})</p> </li> <li> <p>Boy Scout Trail     (https://www.boyscouttrail.com/boy-scouts/merit-badges.asp)</p> </li> <li> <p>US Scouting Service Project     (http://www.usscouts.org/mb/mbindex.asp)</p> </li> </ul> <p>Working with a Merit Badge Counselor</p> <p>Counselors are volunteers and want Scouts to complete merit badges. Many of them are parents of your fellow Scouts in Troop 54. They will do their best to help you if you keep them apprised of your progress and have patience with them in scheduling meetings. If you don't hear from a counselor a few days after sending an email, please follow up with a second email. Adults can get busy, or email can get lost, so do not hesitate to try again.</p> <p>As a cornerstone of Scouting, both counselors and Scouts must always observe Youth Protection guidelines. Scouts and counselors must always copy a parent or guardian on any communication. If a Scout wishes to meet with a counselor for a one-on-one session, the Scout must plan to include a parent in the meeting if a second adult will not otherwise be present. If a second adult, whether parent or other, is not present, expect the counselor to terminate the discussion and ask to reschedule the meeting.</p> <p>With the advent of video conferencing software such as Zoom, counselors may ask Scouts to meet virtually rather than in person. This mode of communication is acceptable but still subject to Youth Protection guidelines.</p> <p>External Merit Badge Classes</p> <p>The Sam Houston Area Council has approved certain organizations to offer merit badge camps or classes. For instance, the Houston Museum of Natural Science offers selected merit badges using approved counselors throughout the year.</p> <p>Here are the signs of a good merit badge class or workshop:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Prerequisites are listed for requirements that should be completed     before the class or for items that need to be brought to the class.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sponsoring organization makes it clear which requirements cannot     be completed at the class and must be done before or after the     class. These should include requirements that require a log or diary     kept over several weeks.</p> </li> <li> <p>The sponsoring organization lists the resources that it will make     available during the class.</p> </li> <li> <p>If asked, the sponsoring organization can present evidence that the     counselor is registered with the Sam Houston Area Council and is     current on Youth Protection Training.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Merit Badge Process</p> <ol> <li> <p>Ask the appropriate adult leader to initiate the process before     beginning any merit badge.</p> </li> <li> <p>PASM for merit badges offered by SHAC-approved counselors or     organizations</p> </li> <li> <p>Scoutmaster for merit badges offered outside of SHAC</p> </li> </ol> <p>The adult leader will either approve beginning the merit badge in Scoutbook or issue a blue card.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Identify in your request how you will be counseled for the merit     badge by providing the following information:</p> </li> <li> <p>Merit badge class or workshop</p> </li> <li> <p>Merit badge counselor you identified on your own, who should be from     the approved list of the Sam Houston Area Council (available in     Scoutbook)</p> </li> <li> <p>Merit badge counselor recommended by your PASM or Scoutmaster</p> </li> </ol> <p>In rare cases, you might identify a counselor outside the Sam Houston Area Council. If so, please ask that counselor for the following information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Evidence of approval to counsel the merit badge from another BSA     council</p> </li> <li> <p>Evidence of current Youth Protection Training</p> </li> </ul> <p>Troop 54 leaders are unable to see this information in Scoutbook for counselors outside the Sam Houston Area Council. Only the Troop 54 Scoutmaster may approve such counselors.</p> <ol> <li> <p>You can begin work on a merit badge before you have a counselor, but     the counselor makes the final decision on whether to accept it     (which is why it's best to reach out to a counselor before you     start). Once you have a counselor, the best practice is to meet at     least twice with the counselor. The first meeting is to set     expectations and to cover any requirements already completed. The     second meeting is to complete all remaining requirements, especially     if logs or journals are part of the requirements. Some Scouts do     complete a merit badge in one sitting with a counselor, and some     need more than two meetings.</p> </li> <li> <p>After you have completed all requirements, and a merit badge     counselor has approved all of them in Scoutbook or on a blue card,     you still need approval in Scoutbook or a signature on your blue     card from your PASM or Scoutmaster. He or she may ask you for how     you completed one or more of the requirements as a quality-control     check.</p> </li> <li> <p>Please retain all of your worksheets, essays, projects, logs, etc.     until you have completed this step. Your PASM or Scoutmaster,     however, will not retest you on any requirement.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your PASM or Scoutmaster realizes that you are missing a     requirement or were not asked to demonstrate a requirement, they     will help you find a counselor to complete the requirement.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you go to a merit badge workshop or class and do not meet all of     the requirements at the class, please ask your PASM or Scoutmaster     to recommend a merit badge counselor to help you complete the     remainder.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Recommended Merit Badge Sequence</p> <p>Based upon the experience of Troops 54 and 55, Eagle\u2010required merit badges and certain non\u2010Eagle-required badges are best earned at different levels of physical and mental maturity. The troop recommends approaching these merit badges in the following age\u2010appropriate sequence.

In all cases, the two guides are the final authority if they address a specific issue.</p> <p>Introduction</p> <p>Every parent can help Scouts by serving as a merit\u2010badge counselor (MBC) for one, several, or many merit badges. As a coach, the counselor advises the Scout about steps to take to fulfill the badge's requirements. As a counselor, he or she evaluates the Scout's performance and determines whether the Scout has met the prescribed objectives in the requirements.</p> <p>Requirements to Serve as a Counselor</p> <p>Merit badge counselors must be men and women of good character, age 18 or older, who are recognized as having the skills and education in the subjects for which they are to serve as MBCs, as well as the ability to work with Scout\u2010age girls and boys.</p> <p>Merit badge counselors must be registered for that position with the Boy Scouts of America (using the Adult Application form), in addition to any registration as an adult leader with a troop. All merit badge counselors must be approved by the Council advancement committee.</p> <p>Merit badge counselors are not required to pay an adult leader registration fee if they are only registered as merit badge counselors.</p> <p>Merit badge counselors must complete the Youth Protection Training course, either online or in person, and should also complete the \"This is Scouting\" online training; see the Training for Adult Leaders section of this Handbook for more details.</p> <p>An older Scout (who is by definition not yet 18 years old) may assist an adult merit badge counselor in teaching a merit badge subject. The adult counselor, however, must verify that each Scout who works on the badge has completed all requirements for the badge. This policy is the basis for Scouts teaching merit badges at summer camps.</p> <p>Application Process for Merit Badge Counselor (\"MBC\")</p> <p>The process to become a merit badge counselor is straightforward but does have a few quirks. Counselors are adult leaders who volunteer at the Council level, not at the Troop or District level. Consequently, even if you have registered as an adult leader with Troop 54, you need to file a new Adult Application (form 524-541), which can be found at the following link:</p> <ul> <li>[https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/524-501.pdf]{.underline}</li> </ul> <p>Don't forget to initial the two certifications next to your signature. SHAC might or might not perform another background check if you have registered previously, but please sign the authorization for the check. Also, you must attach a copy of your latest Youth Protection Training certificate.</p> <p>At one time, the application required you to specify that you were registering for Position 42 -- Merit Badge Counselor, but that field has been dropped from the latest form.</p> <p>In addition to the Adult Application, you need to file a Merit Badge Counselor Information form (form 34405), which can be found at the following link:</p> <ul> <li>[https://filestore.scouting.org/filestore/pdf/34405.pdf]{.underline}</li> </ul> <p>The following merit badges require specific certifications or training to counsel:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Climbing</p> </li> <li> <p>Snow Sports</p> </li> <li> <p>Canoeing</p> </li> <li> <p>Kayaking</p> </li> <li> <p>Lifesaving</p> </li> <li> <p>Motor Boating</p> </li> <li> <p>Rowing</p> </li> <li> <p>Scuba Diving</p> </li> <li> <p>Small Boat Sailing</p> </li> <li> <p>Swimming</p> </li> <li> <p>Water Sports</p> </li> <li> <p>Whitewater</p> </li> <li> <p>Archery</p> </li> <li> <p>Rifle Shooting</p> </li> <li> <p>Shotgun Shooting</p> </li> </ul> <p>For any of these merit badges, please review section 7.0.1.1 of the Guide to Advancement for specific requirements and note your qualifications on the form. You should also consult the Guide to Safe Scouting for specific activity requirements.</p> <p>For other merit badges, you do not need to describe your qualifications in elaborate detail, nor do you need to be an expert. A hobbyist level of interest and competency is adequate in most cases.

The guides referenced in the beginning of this section are also excellent resources for understanding better the role of MBCs.</p> <p>Restrictions on Counseling Badges</p> <p>There is no restriction or limit on the number of merit badges for which an individual may be approved as a counselor.</p> <p>Under BSA policy, a registered merit badge counselor may counsel any Scout, including his or her own daughter, ward, or relative. Troop 54, however, encourages adults not to counsel their own daughters except as part of a class of at least five Scouts.</p> <p>Working with Scouts</p> <p>+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | YPT guidelines for merit badge counseling are best implemented as     | | follows:                                                              | |                                                                       | | -   Any discussion between a counselor and one or more Scouts must    | |     occur within view of a second adult, whether in person or by      | |     teleconferencing.                                                 | |                                                                       | | -   Is a second adult is within view but not within earshot of the    | |     discussion, a single Scout must have a buddy.                     | +=======================================================================+ +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+</p> <p>The Scout should teach herself the necessary knowledge to the greatest extent possible, using the merit badge pamphlet and other resources. One of the benefits of the merit\u2010badge program is teaching Scouts to teach themselves (\"Give someone a fish, and you feed him or her for a day; teach someone to fish, and you feed him or her for a lifetime.\").</p> <p>Encourage the Scout to develop a timetable of short\u2010 and long\u2010term goals for completing the merit badge. An important objective of Scouting is to teach Scouts to set goals for themselves and to plan and execute the tasks required to reach those goals.</p> <p>You might find that a Scout needs help in learning particular skills that are required for the merit badge. Teaching those skills is a key role of the MBC. A best practice in those cases is to use the Scouts BSA EDGE method (Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, Enable).</p> <p>If you stop hearing from a Scout who has started but not finished a merit badge, follow up periodically to check on her progress and on her plans for completing the requirements. Again, the Scout should be setting goals; the counselor's job is simply to help the Scout achieve those goals and confirm that she has done so.</p> <p>Be supportive and not critical, but make sure the Scout has indeed satisfactorily completed each requirement.</p>"},{"location":"Troop54-handbook/#mission-statements","title":"Mission Statements","text":"<p>Troop 54: Troop 54 is an open organization with exceptional resources dedicated to instilling in girls the values of the Scout Oath and Law.

General scholarship philosophy. Troop 54 will provide scholarships, in accordance with these guidelines, for Scouts with a genuine financial need, who could not participate in a particular event without the Troop's financial assistance.</p> <p>2. Identifying scholarship candidates. The Scoutmaster and PASMs should make a positive effort, for each weekend campout and each summer camp, to identify Scouts who cannot afford to attend such event. If a Scout indicates that she will not be attending, and the Scoutmaster or PASM suspects that the cost might be the main reason, they should ask the Scout if she would be interested in being considered for a scholarship.</p> <p>3. Adult leader input. The PASM or Campmaster should advise the Scholarship Committee of his or her recommendations concerning each Scout who requests a scholarship. The Scholarship Committee may also solicit input from other adult leaders to the extent it deems appropriate.</p> <p>4. Dollar amount of scholarships. Scholarships will normally be provided for 50% of the cost of the event in question.</p> <p>5. Scholarships for weekend campouts.</p> <p>(a) Scholarships for weekend campouts, in cases of financial need, may be awarded for the cost of campsite fees, activity fees, and the like, along with the cost of transportation if applicable (for example, charter\u2010bus fees). (b) Grub fees for weekend campouts will normally not be eligible for scholarships (because the Scout's family likely would have to spend at least that much to feed the Scout anyway).</p> <p>6. Summer\u2010camp scholarships. Scouts will normally be considered for summer\u2010camp scholarships as follows:</p> <p>(a) Merit\u2010badge camps: Any Scout who has a financial need will normally be awarded a scholarship for one merit\u2010badge camp per summer at the geographically\u2010closest camp that the Troop attends.</p> <p>(b) High\u2010adventure camps: If a Scout who has a financial need has consistently been active in the Troop and demonstrated Scout spirit, then on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis the Scout may be awarded a scholarship for one high\u2010adventure camp per summer. Scholarships normally will not be awarded for high\u2010adventure camps that are unusually costly; for example, Blue Ridge or Packard likely would qualify for a scholarship but Alaska probably would not.</p> <p>7. Other means of paying for camps. All Scouts are encouraged to participate in the Troop's fundraising opportunities, including the sale of popcorn and Scout Fair tickets. Many of our Scouts have raised hundreds of dollars from these sales that they could apply toward the cost of summer camp.</p> <p>8. Adult scholarships. Adult leaders will normally not be eligible for scholarships.</p> <p>9. National Youth Leadership Training.</p> <p>(a) Any Scout, regardless of financial need, who attends SHAC's one\u2010week National Youth Leadership Training course (\"NYLT\") shall be reimbursed by the Troop for the NYLT fee upon request, because of the benefit of NYLT to the Troop. Parents not having a financial need are encouraged to have their daughters apply for reimbursement anyway (to reinforce the message that NYLT is important to the Troop) and then to make whatever donation to the Troop they feel is appropriate.</p> <p>(b) Scholarships to the National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience conducted at Philmont may be awarded on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis, taking into account the Scout's level of consistent participation in the Troop and demonstrated Scout spirit.</p> <p>10. Troop dues scholarships. The Scholarship Committee may award scholarships for Troop dues on the same general basis as provided above.</p> <p>11. Other scholarships. The Scholarship Committee may award other scholarships (including for Uniforms), consistent with prudent use of Troop funds, when it deems such awards to be in the best interests of the Troop.</p> <p>12. Confidentiality. A Scout's request for a scholarship, and the Scholarship Committee's consideration of and decision on the request, should not be disclosed to other Scouts, and should be disclosed to other adult leaders only on a need\u2010to\u2010know basis.</p> <p>13. Leadership / service projects. The PASM of a Scout who receives a scholarship should privately, informally, and tactfully encourage the Scout to \"do something extra\" for the Troop as a way of giving back. This should not be done in a way that might discourage Scouts from seeking scholarship help.</p> <p>14.

An example of such a camp is the Sam Houston Area Council's Camp Strake near Cold Spring in east Texas. It is particularly important for new Scouts to attend a merit badge summer camp, although Scout of any age can benefit. Excellent facilities are provided for difficult\u2010to\u2010obtain merit badges such as Swimming, Canoeing, Rowing, Lifesaving, Environmental Science, and several others.

Ideally this includes trips to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico for a two\u2010week wilderness backpacking experience. Other camping adventures for older Scouts may involve the BSA Sea Base in Florida; Northern Tier High Adventure Base; canoeing for ten days in Maine; or backpacking in Colorado and Montana; or even Alaska above the Arctic Circle. Troop 54 engages in a variety of these programs every year</p> <p>Many of these \"high-adventure\" camps require that the Scout meet the relevant age limit and sometimes a minimum weight requirement by the program start date. The age minimum for high\u2010adventure camps is generally 13 or 14 (for Philmont it is 14). Attendance at high adventure camp may require new or additional medical forms.</p> <p>Adult participation in summer camps</p> <p>New and experienced adult leaders are always needed for summer camps. Merit badge camps are a wonderful opportunity for adults new to the Troop who have completed the required training to \"break-in\" by spending a week camping with a portion of the Troop. Adult registration for summer camps works differently than for our Scouts. Adults who wish to attend summer camps with the Troop should be aware of the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>All adults attending summer camp are required to complete adult leader training.</p> </li> <li> <p>Selection of adult leaders for our summer\u2010camp programs is up to the Scoutmaster, with the advice and consent of the Troop Committee Chair.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Troop endeavors to find summer camp leaders that understand and accept the responsibility of providing a safe environment for Scouts and can also guide a Scout\u2010led contingent; while being able to effectively respond to emergencies; and know the applicable BSA standards and commit to following them. Adult leaders for summer camp must agree to demonstrate the principles of the Scout Oath and Law as they represent the Troop for our Scouts and many others at camp and during transit.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Troop usually receives a limited number of slots for high\u2010adventure programs. We try to fill those slots with the maximum number of Scouts and the minimum number of qualified adults needed for a safe outing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Payment of deposits is required for adults, as it is for Scouts. Payment of a deposit does not guarantee a slot for a particular adult (if the adult is not selected to participate, the Troop will refund the deposit).</p> </li> <li> <p>Adult participation in summer camps is not first\u2010come, first\u2010served; it is a privilege, not a right. Adult\u2010leader selection, especially for high\u2010adventure programs, takes into account such factors as the following:</p> </li> </ol> <p>a. Completion of all training required to be an Assistant Scoutmaster;</p> <p>b. Commitment to live and act in accordance with the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Active and regular participation in the Troop's monthly camping program;</p> <p>d. Any prior participation in Troop 54 summer camps;</p> <p>e.

Its main responsibilities are (i) supporting the Scoutmaster in delivering quality Troop programs, and (ii) handling Troop administration. The Chair of the Troop Committee serves as something like a non\u2010executive chairperson of the board. He or she is appointed by the chartered organization with input from the Troop Committee. Troop 54 expects to have a very active Troop Committee, essentially all of whom are parents and even grandparents of current Troop 54 Scouts. All Troop 54 Scouts' parents are encouraged to participate in the Troop Committee. (Participating parents should register with the BSA as committee members.) See the MeritBadge.org \"Troop Committee\" Web page for a helpful discussion of the role of a troop committee and its various subcommittees and positions.

BoR's must be requested at least one full day advance (by the end of Sunday if you plan to have a BoR on Monday), and week in advance is preferred. Each Scout who scheduled a BoR needs to bring with her a parent who can volunteer to do a BoR for another scout that same evening.  This does not apply for BoRs during camping trips. A Scout needs to arrive in Full Class A Uniform and upon arrival, should sign-up with the Advancement Chair to hold a slot and to and obtain a BoR form. In order not to delay the start time of BoRs it is important to know that Scoutmaster Conferences should not be planned on the same day of the BoR.
